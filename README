PostgreSQL Multiple Precision Arithmetic extension
==================================================

This extension adds support in PostgreSQL for the data types and
function avaliable in the GMP library for arbitrary precision
arithmetic.

The GMP data types are available as PostgreSQL data types and all the
functions exposed in the library are available from SQL.

How people could have possibly lived without having general precision
floating point and rational numbers into their databases is something I
really can't understand.


Status
------

Currently the mpz and mpq are wrapped, with several operators defined. mpz also
has a few aggregation functions defined and comparison operators and btree
index.

Result are interesting: size on disk for mpz is comparable to
numeric, slightly better for bigger numbers. Performance on sum() is always
better for mpz than for numeric, increasing with the numbers size. See
``sandbox/bench`` for tests and results.
