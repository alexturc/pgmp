PostgreSQL Multiple Precision Arithmetic extension
==================================================

This extension adds support in PostgreSQL for the data types and functions
available in the GMP library for arbitrary precision arithmetic.

The extension adds the types `mpz` (arbitrary size integers) and `mpq`
(arbitrary precision rationals) to PostgreSQL and exposes all the functions
available in the GMP library for these data types to the database allowing:

- higher performance arithmetic on integer respect to the ``decimal`` data type

- a rational data type for absolute precision storage and arithmetic

- using specialized functions to deal with prime numbers, random numbers,
  factorization directly into the database.

The GMP data types can be stored into the database, used in mixed
arithmetic with other PostgreSQL types and indexed using the btree method.

Please refer to the documentation for installation and usage, either online
or in the ``docs/`` directory.
