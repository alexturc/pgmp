PostgreSQL Multiple Precision Arithmetic extension
==================================================

This extension adds support in PostgreSQL for the data types and
function avaliable in the GMP library for arbitrary precision
arithmetic.

The GMP data types are available as PostgreSQL data types and all the
functions exposed in the library are available from SQL.

How people could have possibly lived without having general precision
floating point and rational numbers into their databases is something I
really can't understand.


Status
------

The library version is 0.0: there is no single line written and
everything is just a dream.
